Trees and Heaps Handout 
Due: Tuesday, October 20th 

NOTES: 

- For the exercises, please do NOT use online resources. They are common algorithm questions so
    they have answers online but it won't help your understanding.
- If you are stuck or want help on any of them, come to office hours!

Exercises

    1. Using the node class we created in class, implement functions to represent the 
        3 different orders  you can use to recursively conduct DFS 
        (each order should have a function).

    2. Implement a priority queue simply using list. PQ class should include functions 
        that check if the PQ is empty, adds an element to the PQ, and finally removes 
        an element. 

        Reminder: Most of the logic in terms of how a PQ works is in how it REMOVES 
        an element (highest priority element is dequeued).

    3. Now implement a PQ using a linked list. 

    4. Implement a min-heap class demonstrating common heap functions. Your class should include functions 
        that initialize a min-heap using a list, insert a new node, decrease the value of node at index 'i' 
        to new value (with new value being less than old value), remove the min node, deleting a node
        at index "i", and finally returning the minimum value. Feel free to include more functions if you wish.

        Hint: Utilize built-in functions (heappush, heappop, heapify) from module heapq.  

    5. Time complexity - what is the time complexity of a PQ implemented as a linked list vs a binary heap?
