EXERCISES 

1. Suppose we have 243 identical-looking boxes each containing a drone ready to ship, but we remember that one box is
missing instructions! This box will weigh a little less than the rest and there is a scale that can compare weights of any
two sets of boxes. Assuming the worst case scenario, what is the minimum number of weightings needed to determine
which box has the missing instructions?

Hint: review the Tower of Hanoi stuff from class

2. Implement the following sorting algos (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort) in Python. Use comments to denotate which pieces of
code refer to the recursive process of divide, conquer, and combine. Include 3-5 test cases for each algo.

Hint: review the pseudocode from the lecture notes

3. In terms of time complexity, which one is more efficent - Merge Sort or Quick Sort? What about space memory efficency?
