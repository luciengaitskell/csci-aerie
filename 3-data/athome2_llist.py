- For the python exercises, please do NOT use online resources. They are common algorithm questions so
	they have answers online but it won't help your understanding. 
- If you are stuck or want help on any of them, come to office hours!

#5. Recursion Detour

"""
    In class we discussed how a linked list is a recursive data structure. Recursion is very important to understand 
    because 1) it can simplify code 2) can speed up programs by requiring less information to be stored. One famous ex
    of recursion is the Fibonacci sequence. 

    TODO: The Fibonacci sequence is dened as follows: the rst number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth
            number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth 
            Fibonacci number.
