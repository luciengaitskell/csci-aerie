Stacks and Queues Handout 
Due: Tuesday, October 13th 

NOTES: 

- For the exercises, please do NOT use online resources. They are common algorithm questions so
    they have answers online but it won't help your understanding.
- If you are stuck or want help on any of them, come to office hours!

## Exercises

# 1.  Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

# 2. How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop,
#       has a function min which returns the minimum element?

# 3. In reference to question 2, what is the run time of all of these three operations?

# 4.  Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks

# 5.  Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
#       an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
#       (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

# 6.  Remember this question from the arrays homework?
#       "Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous
#       subarrays whose sum equals to k."
#
#       With you new understanding of how hashtables work, implement a solution to this problem using a dictionary.
