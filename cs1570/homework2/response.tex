\section{Problem 2}

\subsection{Part 1}

Assume the day begins at $d_o$ and ends as $d_e$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Counterexample:} Suppose workshop $1$, such that $s_1 = d_o$
    and $t_1 = d_e$. Suppose there is another workshop ($2$) that starts a minute
    after workshop $1$ and ends during workshop $1$. $\therefore s_2=s_1 + 1, t_2=x$
    such that $s_1+1 < x < t_1$. Suppose another workshop $3$, such that 
    $s_3 = x, t_3 = d_e$.

    This greedy algorithm will select workshop $1$ due to the earlier starting time.
    However, selecting workshop $1$ will cause workshop $2$ and $3$ to be removed.
    Therefore, only one workshop will be selected to visit,
    despite the opportunity to visit two during the day.

    \item \textbf{Proof:} When selecting the next latest event, any overlaps are removed.
    Therefore, If this other workshop which started earlier was kept, than the current
    worshop could not be visited. In this case, it is safer to chose the later workshop,
    as it can not cause any other conflicts. Therefore, this algorithm will give you the
    most number of workshops able to visit.

    \item \textbf{Counterexample:} Suppose three workshops:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
            \item Length x
            \item Length x+1
            \item Length x+1
        \end{enumerate}

        Suppose workshop $2$ and $3$ immediately follow each other, and workshop $1$ overlaps both.
        Workshop $1$ will be selected first, and others will be excluded.
        However, selecting workshop $2$ and $3$ is the more optimal solution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Part 2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $S$ be the list of stands
    \item Let $V$ contain each visit
    \item Calculate necessary trips, given stands $S$
    \item Sort stands by open time in increasing order
    \item Start with stands of smallest lengths open, and find all overlapping workshops
        % THIS IS A BIT WOOLY
    \item Combine all overlapping workshops into one visit, add to $V$ and remove from $S$
    \item Continue until $S$ is empty
    \item Return $V$
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm must return the optimal solution, as it prioritizes the least flexible stands.
Each greedy step will not compromise any following step, as each subsequent stand is more flexible.
